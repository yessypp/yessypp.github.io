# Yessy Purnama
Backend Software Engineer II at Zalora Group

## ABOUT

7+ years as a Software Engineer with a proven track record of designing and developing robust backend systems. I have successfully delivered scalable and efficient distributed backend systems, especially in customer-facing products. My proficiency in Go allows me to quickly adapt to new technologies and apply best practices in microservices.

I’m a curious problem-solving person and love to observe how technology makes people’s life easier. I find comfort in witnessing how the products or features I build impact the end user. I’m a motivated learner with a strong work ethic. My attention to detail and collaboration skills enable me to effectively identify and resolve complex technical challenges. 

I’m particularly interested in discussing how other people scale their systems up. Let’s get connected and learn from one another.
